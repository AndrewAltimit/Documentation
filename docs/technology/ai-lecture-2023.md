## Neural Networks

### Key Components and Architecture

Neural networks are computational models that are designed to mimic the way the human brain processes information. They consist of interconnected nodes or units called neurons, which are organized in layers. The primary components of a neural network are neurons, weights, biases, and activation functions.

**Neurons:** Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of neural networks. They are inspired by the biological neurons present in the human brain. In a neural network, neurons are organized in layers: the input layer, one or more hidden layers, and the output layer. Each neuron receives input from multiple other neurons and processes it to produce an output. The output is then sent as input to the neurons in the subsequent layer.

**Weights:** Weights are the numerical values that represent the strength of the connections between neurons in the neural network. They can be thought of as the parameters of the network that are learned during training. Each input to a neuron is multiplied by a corresponding weight value. The weighted sum of all inputs is then calculated, and this weighted sum is fed into an activation function to produce the neuron's output. Weights are adjusted during the training process to minimize the error between the network's predictions and the actual target values.

**Biases:** Biases are additional parameters in neural networks that, similar to weights, are learned during training. They allow the neural network to be more flexible and adaptable in learning complex patterns. A bias term is added to the weighted sum of inputs before being passed to the activation function. This allows the neuron to shift the activation function along the input axis, which can be crucial for learning complex patterns and making accurate predictions. Biases help the network model patterns that do not necessarily pass through the origin of the input space.

**Activation Functions:** Activation functions are mathematical functions that introduce non-linearity into the neural network. They are applied to the weighted sum of inputs (plus the bias) of each neuron to determine the neuron's output. Activation functions play a vital role in determining the output of a neuron and the overall behavior of the network

### Transformer Capabilities

**Understand Language**

- **Syntax and semantics:** Transformers can capture complex syntactic and semantic structures in language, enabling them to understand context and relationships between words, phrases, and sentences.
- **Contextual embeddings:** Transformer models generate embeddings that capture the context of words within a sequence, leading to more accurate representations of word meanings.

**Generate Language**

- **Coherent and contextually relevant text:** Transformers can generate highly coherent text that is contextually relevant to the input, making them suitable for tasks such as text summarization, machine translation, and dialogue generation.
- **Fine-grained control:** Advanced techniques, such as prefix-tuning and controlled text generation, allow for greater control over the generated output, enabling customization and adherence to specific guidelines or requirements.

### Transformer Architecture

</p>
<br><br>

- **Positional Encoding:** Injects information about the position of words or tokens in the sequence. This is typically done using sine and cosine functions with different frequencies.

- **Multi-Head Attention:** Weighs the importance of different words in a sequence when processing a particular word. Multi-head attention splits the input data into multiple "heads" and computes the attention scores independently for each head. These scores are then combined to produce the final output. This allows the model to capture different aspects of the input data and relationships between words.

- **Encoders:** Encoder layers are stacked where each encoder layer consists of two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. The output of each sub-layer is processed by a residual connection followed by layer normalization.

- **Decoders:** Decoder layers are stacked where each decoder layer consists of three sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism, a multi-head cross-attention mechanism that attends to the output of the encoder stack, and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. As with the encoders, residual connections and layer normalization are used.

- **Feed-forward:** Position-wise feed-forward networks are employed in both encoder and decoder layers to learn non-linear relationships between input features and apply those learnings to the attention mechanism's output. It operates independently on each position in the sequence, allowing for efficient parallelization.

- **Softmax:** Generate a probability distribution over the target vocabulary. It converts the logits (raw output values) from the final linear layer into probabilities, ensuring that they sum to 1. In various NLP tasks, such as machine translation or text summarization, the Transformer uses the softmax output probabilities to select the most likely word or token at each position in the generated sequence.

</p>
</center>

Self-attention refers to the ability of the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence relative to each other when making predictions. This allows the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input while ignoring less important parts, effectively learning to attend to different positions of the sequence.

The self-attention mechanism works as follows:

1. **Input embeddings:** The input sequence (e.g., a sentence) is first converted into a set of continuous vectors using an embedding layer. These vectors represent each token (word or subword) in the input sequence.

2. **Linear transformation:** For each input token, three vectors are derived by applying three separate linear transformations (i.e., multiplication by three weight matrices). These three vectors are called the Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) vectors. See the video below this list for an analogy to help understand the concept of self-attention.

3. **Scaled Dot-Product Attention:** For each input token, the similarity between its Query vector and the Key vectors of all other tokens in the sequence is computed using dot products. These similarities are then scaled by a factor (usually the square root of the dimension of the Key vector) to prevent large dot products from dominating the softmax function that follows.

4. **Softmax normalization:** The scaled similarity scores are passed through a softmax function, which normalizes them into a probability distribution. This results in a set of attention weights that sum to one, representing the relative importance of each token in the input sequence concerning the current token.

5. **Weighted sum:** The attention weights are then used to compute a weighted sum of the Value vectors corresponding to each token in the sequence. This weighted sum is the output of the self-attention mechanism for the current token, and it represents the attended context for that token.

6. **Multi-head attention:** To capture different aspects of the relationships between tokens, the Transformer uses multiple parallel self-attention mechanisms called "heads." Each head computes its self-attention independently, and their outputs are concatenated and linearly transformed to form the final output of the multi-head attention layer.

The self-attention mechanism allows the Transformer to effectively model long-range dependencies and complex relationships between tokens in a sequence. This has led to significant improvements in various natural language processing tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and question-answering.

### BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
BERT is built upon the Transformer architecture with a unique aspect regarding its bidirectional context. Unlike traditional language models that process text in a unidirectional manner (left-to-right or right-to-left), BERT processes text in both directions simultaneously. This bidirectional approach enables BERT to better understand the context of words, as it considers both the preceding and following words in a sentence. BERT also uses a tokenization technique called WordPiece to handle out-of-vocabulary words and improve generalization. WordPiece breaks down words into smaller subword units, allowing BERT to represent rare and unseen words more effectively.

BERT's training consists of two main steps: pre-training and fine-tuning.

1. **Pre-training:** BERT is pre-trained on a large corpus of text using two unsupervised learning tasks: Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP).

    - **Masked Language Modeling:** In MLM, BERT learns to predict masked words in a sentence. A certain percentage of words in the input sequence are randomly masked, and BERT is trained to predict the original words based on their surrounding context.

    - **Next Sentence Prediction:** In NSP, BERT learns to predict whether two sentences are related or not. It is trained on sentence pairs, where half of the pairs are consecutive sentences and the other half are unrelated sentences.

2. **Fine-tuning:** After pre-training, BERT is fine-tuned on specific tasks using labeled data. The pre-trained model is adapted to the target task by adding task-specific layers and training the entire model with a smaller learning rate. This process allows BERT to transfer the knowledge gained from the pre-training phase to the target task effectively.


### GPT: Generative Pre-trained Transformers
<p class="referenceBoxes type3"><img src="https://andrewaltimit.github.io/Documentation/images/file-pdf-fill.svg" class="icon"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf"> Paper: <b><i>GPT-3: Language Models are Few-Shot Learners</i></b></a></p>

The Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is a family of language models based on the Transformer architecture, which has demonstrated impressive natural language understanding and generation capabilities. 

**GPT (2018)**

The first GPT model set a new standard in natural language understanding and generation. It was pre-trained via unsupervised learning on a large volume of text using a unidirectional (left-to-right) Transformer architecture and contains 117 million parameters

**GPT-2 (2019)**

GPT-2 is an improved version of the original GPT model and contains 1.5 billion parameters. It is trained on a larger dataset (WebText), resulting in a more powerful language model that could generate highly coherent and contextually relevant text. 

**GPT-3 (2020)**

GPT-3 contains 175 billion parameters and demonstrates strong performance on a wide range of NLP tasks with minimal fine-tuning. The model is trained on an even larger dataset (WebText 2) than the previous iteration and demonstrates few-shot and zero-shot learning capabilities

**GPT-4 (2023)**

GPT-4 contains 170 trillion parameters and is 82% less likely to respond to requests for disallowed content and 40% more likely to produce factual responses than GPT-3.5 according to OpenAI internal evaluations.

#### Training

1. **Pre-training**: GPT models are pre-trained on a large volume of text using unsupervised learning. During pre-training, the models learn to generate text by predicting the next token in a sequence, given the previous tokens. This process allows them to capture general language patterns and structures.

2. **Fine-tuning**: After pre-training, GPT models are fine-tuned on specific tasks using smaller labeled datasets. Fine-tuning adapts the pre-trained model to perform the desired task, such as text classification, sentiment analysis, or machine translation.

#### Key Features

**Transfer Learning**

Transfer learning is a process in which a model is trained on a large dataset and then used to generate predictions on a new dataset. This means that GPT-4 can be used to quickly create models for a variety of tasks without having to start from scratch. By leveraging transfer learning, GPT models can achieve high performance on a wide range of tasks, even when labeled data is scarce.

**Few-Shot Learning**

Few-shot learning is a machine learning approach where models are trained to perform tasks with a limited number of examples, typically in the range of 1-20 examples per class.

1. **In-context learning**: GPT-3 and other large-scale Transformer models can perform few-shot learning through in-context learning. By providing a few examples of the desired task within the input, the model can infer the desired output format and generate appropriate responses.

2. **Prompt engineering**: The effectiveness of few-shot learning in GPT models can be enhanced by designing effective prompts that guide the model towards the desired behavior. This process, known as prompt engineering, involves carefully crafting input examples and queries to elicit the correct response from the model.

Few-shot learning allows GPT models to perform well on new tasks with minimal or no task-specific fine-tuning, reducing the need for labeled data and making them more versatile and adaptable.

## Looking Ahead

**AI as a tool, not a replacement**

Firstly, it's crucial to recognize that AI is not here to replace us, but rather to augment our capabilities. Just as the invention of the printing press or the computer did not replace humans, AI, too, will not replace us. Instead, it will help us become more efficient, accurate, and productive in our work. By automating repetitive tasks and analyzing vast amounts of data, AI can free us to focus on more creative and high-level responsibilities.

As AI capabilities advance, we will see a shift towards collaboration between humans and AI systems. This will require a new mindset, where we view AI as a partner rather than a competitor. By learning how to effectively collaborate with AI, we can leverage its strengths to complement our own, resulting in better outcomes for all.

**Continuous learning and adaptation**

As the workplace evolves, so should our skills. To remain relevant in the job market, we must continuously learn and adapt to new technologies, including AI. This may include taking online courses, attending workshops, or acquiring certifications in AI and related fields. By doing so, we'll not only enhance our skill set but also demonstrate our adaptability and willingness to embrace change.

**Advocate for responsible AI development and implementation**

Finally, it's important for us to advocate for the responsible development and implementation of AI. This means ensuring that AI systems are transparent, fair, and accountable. By pushing for ethical AI, we can work towards a future where AI benefits everyone, without exacerbating inequalities or causing undue harm.
