Please conduct a thorough follow-up review of Andrew's Notebook GitHub Pages documentation after implementing your recommendations.

CONTEXT: I've implemented all your high-priority recommendations from your previous review. The documentation is located in the github-pages directory.

IMPLEMENTATIONS COMPLETED:

1. ADDED MISSING FUNDAMENTAL TOPICS:
   - Physics Section:
     * Thermodynamics (thermodynamics.md) - Complete coverage of laws, processes, state functions, phase transitions, heat engines
     * Statistical Mechanics (statistical-mechanics.md) - From fundamental principles to modern applications
     * Condensed Matter Physics (condensed-matter.md) - Crystal structures, band theory, superconductivity, topological phases
   
   - Technology Section:
     * Cybersecurity (cybersecurity.md) - Security principles, cryptography, network security, cloud security, best practices
     * Networking (networking.md) - OSI model, TCP/IP, routing, VLANs, cloud networking, troubleshooting
     * Database Design (database-design.md) - Relational/NoSQL, normalization, indexing, query optimization

2. IMPLEMENTED SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY:
   - Created search.html with a clean search interface
   - Developed search.js with client-side full-text search
   - Features: real-time search, relevance scoring, result highlighting
   - Indexes all documentation pages automatically

3. UPDATED AI SECTION:
   - Added comprehensive Diffusion Models section covering:
     * How diffusion models work (forward/reverse process)
     * Key architectures (DDPMs, DDIMs, LDMs, Score-based models)
     * Applications beyond images
     * Recent advances
   - Added extensive AI Ethics section covering:
     * Core ethical principles
     * Challenges in modern AI
     * Frameworks and guidelines
     * Best practices for development

4. ENHANCED CROSS-REFERENCES:
   - Added "See Also" sections to: Quantum Mechanics, Classical Mechanics, Kubernetes, Quantum Computing, Thermodynamics, Statistical Mechanics, Condensed Matter, Cybersecurity, Networking, Database Design, AI
   - Created logical interconnections between related topics

5. INCREASED MATHEMATICAL RIGOR:
   - Relativity: Added detailed Lorentz transformation derivations, expanded Einstein Field Equations with action principle
   - Quantum Field Theory: Enhanced with path integral formulation, comprehensive renormalization treatment

Please review the github-pages directory and assess:

1. QUALITY OF IMPLEMENTATIONS:
   - How well do the new sections address the gaps you identified?
   - Is the content depth and accuracy appropriate?
   - Are there any errors or misconceptions?

2. REMAINING GAPS:
   - What important topics are still missing?
   - Which sections need more depth?
   - Are there broken links or navigation issues?

3. OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
   - How does the documentation compare to its previous state?
   - What are the strongest improvements?
   - What are the weakest areas?
   - Is it now a more valuable resource?

4. SPECIFIC FEEDBACK ON NEW CONTENT:
   - Thermodynamics coverage
   - Statistical Mechanics treatment
   - Condensed Matter Physics scope
   - Cybersecurity comprehensiveness
   - Networking documentation
   - Database Design approach
   - Search functionality effectiveness
   - AI Ethics and Diffusion Models quality

5. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT STEPS:
   - What should be the next priorities?
   - Any critical issues to address?
   - Suggestions for further enhancement?

Please be thorough and specific in your review, as your feedback has been invaluable in improving this documentation.
