      <p>Git is a version control system that tracks changes to your files over time. Think of it as a sophisticated "undo" system that remembers every change you've ever made.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Save snapshots of your work (commits)</li>
        <li>See what changed and when</li>
        <li>Collaborate without conflicts</li>
        <li>Recover from mistakes easily</li>

      <h4>The Three States</h4>
      <p>Git has three main states for your files:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Modified</strong> - You've changed the file but haven't saved it to Git yet</li>
        <li><strong>Staged</strong> - You've marked a modified file to go into your next commit</li>
        <li><strong>Committed</strong> - The data is safely stored in your local database</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Basic Workflow</h4>
      <pre><code>1. Modify files in your working directory
      2. Stage the changes you want to commit
      3. Commit, which takes the staged changes and stores them permanently</code></pre>

        <li>Add some content</li>
        <li>Stage and commit it</li>

      <h4>Understanding Git's Design</h4>
      <p>Git is more than just a version control system—it's a content-addressable filesystem with a VCS user interface. Here's what makes it special:</p>
      
      <h5>Snapshots, Not Differences</h5>
      <p>Unlike other VCS, Git thinks of its data as snapshots of a miniature filesystem. Every commit is a complete snapshot of all your files at that moment.</p>
      
      <h5>Nearly Every Operation Is Local</h5>
      <p>Most Git operations only need local files and resources. You have the entire history on your local disk, making most operations instantaneous.</p>
      
      <h5>Git Has Integrity</h5>
      <p>Everything in Git is checksummed using SHA-1 hash. It's impossible to change any file without Git knowing about it.</p>

      <p>Branching is what makes Git powerful for team collaboration. It allows multiple people to work on different features simultaneously without interfering with each other.</p>
      
      <h4>Key Benefits</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Isolation</strong> - Work on features without breaking the main code</li>
        <li><strong>Experimentation</strong> - Try ideas without commitment</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration</strong> - Multiple developers work in parallel</li>
        <li><strong>Code Review</strong> - Review changes before merging</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Common Strategies</h4>
      <p>Different teams use different branching strategies based on their needs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Git Flow - For scheduled releases</li>
        <li>GitHub Flow - For continuous deployment</li>
        <li>GitLab Flow - For environment-based deployment</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Branch Mechanics</h4>
      <p>A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to a commit. The default branch name is <code>main</code> (or <code>master</code> in older repos).</p>
      
      <h4>Creating and Switching Branches</h4>
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># Create a new branch
      git branch feature-name
      
      # Switch to the branch
      git checkout feature-name
      
      # Or do both at once
      git checkout -b feature-name
      
      # View all branches
      git branch -a</code></pre>
      
      <h4>The HEAD Pointer</h4>
      <p>HEAD is a special pointer that indicates which branch you're currently on. When you commit, the branch pointer moves forward automatically.</p>
      
      <h4>Merging Branches</h4>
      <p>Once your feature is complete, you can merge it back:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># Switch to main branch
      git checkout main
      
      # Merge the feature branch
      git merge feature-name</code></pre>

      <h4>Git Flow Example</h4>
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># Start a new feature
      git checkout -b feature/user-auth develop
      
      # Work on the feature...
      git add .
      git commit -m "Add user authentication"
      
      # Finish the feature
      git checkout develop
      git merge --no-ff feature/user-auth
      git branch -d feature/user-auth
      
      # Create a release
      git checkout -b release/1.0 develop
      # Prepare release...
      git checkout main
      git merge --no-ff release/1.0
      git tag -a v1.0 -m "Version 1.0"</code></pre>
      
      <h4>GitHub Flow Example</h4>
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># Create feature branch from main
      git checkout -b feature/new-feature main
      
      # Make changes and push
      git push -u origin feature/new-feature
      
      # Create pull request on GitHub
      # After review and tests pass, merge to main
      # Deploy immediately</code></pre>
      
      <h4>Best Practices</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep branches short-lived</li>
        <li>Use descriptive branch names</li>
        <li>Delete branches after merging</li>
        <li>Regularly sync with the base branch</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Rebase vs Merge</h4>
      <p>While merging preserves history, rebasing rewrites it for a cleaner timeline:</p>
      
      <pre><code class="language-bash"># Rebase feature onto main
      git checkout feature
      git rebase main
      
      # Interactive rebase to clean up commits
      git rebase -i HEAD~3</code></pre>
      
      <h4>Cherry-Picking</h4>
      <p>Apply specific commits from one branch to another:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">git cherry-pick abc123</code></pre>
      
      <h4>Advanced Workflows</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Forking Workflow</strong> - For open source projects</li>
        <li><strong>Gitflow with Hotfixes</strong> - Emergency production fixes</li>
        <li><strong>Release Trains</strong> - Scheduled feature releases</li>
        <li><strong>Trunk-Based Development</strong> - Continuous integration approach</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>Troubleshooting</h4>
      <p>Common issues and solutions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Detached HEAD state</li>
        <li>Merge conflicts in binary files</li>
        <li>Recovering deleted branches</li>
        <li>Undoing a bad merge</li>
      </ul>
