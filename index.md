### Branching Strategies
**[Andrew's Notes](docs/branching.html)**

Branching strategies are essential for managing the development process in a collaborative environment, ensuring that code changes are isolated, reviewed, and integrated systematically. Here are some popular branching strategies with placeholder links for further reading:

- [Git Branching Model](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches)
- [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- [Git Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)

For each of these strategies, you'll find an overview, advantages, and a step-by-step guide on how to implement them in your development process.

### Build Automation Tools
**[Andrew's Notes](docs/branching.html)**

Build automation tools are essential for streamlining the process of compiling source code, running tests, and packaging the final product for deployment. These tools help developers save time, minimize errors, and maintain a consistent build process. In this section, we'll introduce the Please Build automation tool.

#### Please Build
**[Andrew's Notes](docs/please-build.html)**

Please is an open-source build automation tool that simplifies the process of building, testing, and packaging software. It offers an easy-to-understand syntax, high-performance execution, and supports a variety of languages and platforms.
