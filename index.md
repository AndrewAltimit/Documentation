## Physics

### Classical Mechanics
**[Andrew's Notes](docs/physics/classical.html)**

Classical Mechanics is the study of the motion of objects and the forces that cause this motion. It is based on Newton's laws of motion and covers a wide range of phenomena, from the motion of everyday objects to celestial bodies.

- [Dynamics and Kinematics](#placeholder-link)

### Relativity
**[Andrew's Notes](docs/physics/relativity.html)**

Relativity is a branch of physics that deals with the relationship between space and time. It includes two major theories: Special Relativity and General Relativity, both formulated by Albert Einstein.

- [Gravitational Waves](#placeholder-link)

### Quantum Mechanics
**[Andrew's Notes](docs/physics/quantum.html)**

Quantum Mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic scales. It departs from classical mechanics and introduces the concept of wave-particle duality, among other phenomena.

#### String Theory
**[Andrew's Notes](docs/physics/string-theory.html)**

String Theory is a theoretical framework that posits that the fundamental building blocks of the universe are one-dimensional "strings" rather than point particles. It aims to provide a unified description of gravity and particle physics, potentially reconciling general relativity and quantum mechanics.
